# BSc (Hons) Computer Science L6 Programming Project
## Neural Network From Scratch

This project demonstrates usage of the following technologies:
* __Python (VS Code)__

The task:
1. Develop a neural network ___without external libraries___ with 30, 15, and 2 neurons for input, hidden, and output layers respectively
2. Train and test the model after normalising the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset
3. Plot the training curve using mean squared error over epochs
4. Construct a confusion matrix to measure TP rate, FP rate, and accuracy
5. Retrain and compare the models using 5 and 40 hidden neurons variations and measure the results

___This project has been uploaded as it was submitted to the university and, as such, is only intended to demonstrate coding experience with certain languages, technologies and concepts.___
